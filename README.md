# HOMEWORK: Create A Spaceship Class from User Stories

## Summary
By now you are familiar with object oriented programming - organizing code into classes and objects. In this challenge, you will be creating a class of a real world object only using user stories.

You will be creating a `Spaceship` class that will be used in a video shooting game. Look over the following user stories to understand the structure of your class.

- As a video game player, I want to be able to create a new spaceship and set it's color and style to I can customize it in the video game.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to see the speed I'm traveling, so I can properly accelerate or decelerate.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to accelerate or decelerate the spaceship to a defined speed.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to turn left or right so I can get to a destination and dodge obstacles.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to stop the spaceship so I can rest in various locations.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to fire a weapon from my spaceship so I can destroy obstacles or enemies.
- As a video game player, I want to be able to switch between available weapons so I can choose the best option for a given situation.

What are the characteristics associated with the spaceship?  These are your attributes.  What are the actions associated with your spaceship?  These are your methods. 

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Create a simple list of the attributes and methods (don't worry about your class structure yet!)  Try to be explicit and show if your methods are receiving any parameters.

## Release 1: Write Driver Code
Write out some tests as driver code at the bottom of your file. Base your tests on the following.

- Create a new spaceship of your desired color and style
- Accelerate to 400 miles per hour
- Fire your weapon
- Switch weapons
- Turn left
- Fire your weapon
- Decelerate to 100 miles per hour
- Turn right
- Stop your spaceship

Writing your driver code should help you think through what you should name your methods and how they should work together.

## Release 2: Initial Solution
Use your driver code to write out your class.

## Release 3: Add a Feature
Let's add a new twist to the game by giving your spaceship cargo it can deliver. The purpose of the game now is to deliver packages across enemy territories as quickly as possible. You can choose how to implement this feature, the amount of cargo the spaceship can carry, how it might affect your maximum speed, etc.

## Release 4: Implement a New Class
Create a new class for cargo. What attributes should cargo have? What methods should cargo have?
